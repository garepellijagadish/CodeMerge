Rules Understanding: 
Use a standard deck of cards (no jocker) - which is 52 cards.
Each player is delt only three cards - from set of 52 cards each player gets 3.
'A' is considered to have a number value of 1 - 'A' value is consideed as 1.
'A' is considered the top cad in a face-off. So the order is A>K>Q>J>10 .... 2 - when game is done to decide winner we need to consider the given order.

Victory Understanding
If a player gets all three cards as 'A' - he is the winner.

If a player gets three cards in the below sequence - he is the winner.
eg:
2,3,4; 3,4,5; 4,5,6; 5,6,7; 6,7,8; 7,8,9; 8,9,10;
9    ; 12   ; 15   ; 18   ; 21   ; 24   ; 27

2,4,5; 3,5,6; 4,6,7; 5,7,8; 6,8,9; 7,9,10;
11   ; 14   ; 17   ; 20   ; 23   ; 26

Rule: If the numbers are not in sequence then it will not be divisible by 3.

If a player gets at least two cards of same number - he is the the winner.
eg:
2,2,3; 3,3,4; 4,4,5; 5,5,6; 6,6,7; 7,7,8; 8,8,9; 9,9,10;

understading:
there should be minimum two similar and maximum three similar cards, so the least sum can be 5(1('A'),2,2) and can go upto 39(All 'K').

If all players get different combination than the above then a player who has highest value wins.

If the highest value is with two players then we need to give a chance to get a new card to each player and who ever gets the highest value in newly taken cards will win.

Suit does not matter for all the above.
